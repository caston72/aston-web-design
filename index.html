                        <p>
                        I've made my home base in San Antonio, TX, with my family of four. 
                        My journey into tech started with a degree in education.  As I started working as a Career & Technical Education teacher,
                        my intrest grew for technology and the web. I was fascinated with coding and loved solving problems as I was learning.
                        I was hooked and wanted to build a career from my passion for code.
                        </p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>
                        That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut.  When I learned how to 
                        build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility 
                        I was looking for in my work.  Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, 
                        where I can use my problem solving skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code to bring the website in your imagination to life.
